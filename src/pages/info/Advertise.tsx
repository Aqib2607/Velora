          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed text-base md:text-lg">
            Our platform operates on a dynamic, second-price auction model. You specify the maximum price you are willing to pay for a click (Bid), and our algorithms calculate ad relevance and predicted conversion rates to determine the final ad placement. The second-price auction ensures you never pay more than one cent above the next highest bidder, protecting you from overpaying for premium placements.

          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed text-base md:text-lg">
