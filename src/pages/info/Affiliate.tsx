          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed text-base md:text-lg">
            Our commission structure is tiered based on product categories, allowing you to optimize your content strategy around high-yield verticals. Physical goods generate a percentage-based commission (ranging from 1% to 10% depending on margin profile). Additionally, we offer lucrative flat-rate 'Bounties' for driving sign-ups to Velora ecosystem services such as Velora Prime trials, Velora Music subscriptions, or Velora Business accounts. We continuously strive to push the boundaries of innovation and user-centric design. Across our global regions, our teams are dedicated to optimizing performance, ensuring scalability, and delivering unparalleled value to both consumers and business partners.

          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed text-base md:text-lg">
            Reliable tracking is critical to an affiliate program. We utilize a highly resilient cookie-based attribution system with a standard 24-hour window. If a user clicks your link, you receive credit for *any* qualifying product they place in their cart and subsequently purchase within that window—even if it was not the specific product you linked to. Enhanced 90-day tracking windows apply when users directly add items to their shopping cart. We continuously strive to push the boundaries of innovation and user-centric design. Across our global regions, our teams are dedicated to optimizing performance, ensuring scalability, and delivering unparalleled value to both consumers and business partners. This relentless pursuit of excellence is embedded in our DNA, shaping every decision we make from infrastructure deployment architecture to customer success workflows.

          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed text-base md:text-lg">
            We provide reliable, automated disbursements. Affiliate earnings are calculated monthly and held for a standard 60-day reconciliation period to account for potential customer returns or canceled orders. Once the reconciliation period clears, funds are disbursed directly to your bank account or issued as Velora Gift Cards. A low minimum payment threshold ensures you can access your earnings quickly.

          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed text-base md:text-lg">
            To combat click fraud, cookie stuffing, and algorithmic manipulation, we employ sophisticated fraud detection heuristics. Invalid traffic driven by bots, forced clicks, or hidden iframes is automatically filtered out. We require affiliates to explicitly disclose their relationship with Velora, ensuring compliance with FTC guidelines and maintaining the absolute integrity of our referral ecosystem.
